# webdevbootcamp
By taking the Web Developer BootCamp on Udemy, I developed the SneakerBar website from frontend to backend for those sneaker lovers like me. And you can do the following things on my website:
- Sign up and login to upload/edit/delete your favourite sneakers with the corresponding price and description
- View the sneakers uploades by others
- comment and rate whatever sneakers
- Search the sneakers you want and have a look at the uploader's profile
- Admin can also revise any info of all the sneakers
Feel free to join the SneakerBar https://radiant-sea-89670.herokuapp.com/ and share your favourite sneakers!
