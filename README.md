# webdevbootcamp
By taking the Web Developer BootCamp on Udemy, I developed the SneakerBar website from frontend to backend for those sneaker lovers like me. And you can do the following things on my website:
- Sign up and login to upload/edit/delete your favourite sneakers with the corresponding price and description
- View the sneakers uploaded by others
- Comment and rate whatever sneakers
- Search the sneakers you want and have a look at the uploader's profile
- Admin can also revise any info of all the sneakers

Here are some screenshots of the website:
